<p class='c000'>It is often charged that participants in assemblages of this character
are apt to exaggerate the importance of the occasion they commemorate,
and after the manner of one of our poets, sing in chorus: "I celebrate
myself." Perhaps I can speak of the Wyandotte Convention and its
work without being accused of this self-gratulation; for I was more of an
observer of its proceedings than a participant in them. I recorded what
was done, but I had no part or lot in the doing. If its work had been
crude or weak, I could not fairly have been held responsible for the failure.
As it was strong, efficient and enduring, I can felicitate you, the
survivors of those who wrought this great service for Kansas, without a
suspicion of self-praise.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>KANSAS CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTIONS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Four Conventions framed Constitutions for this State. The first assembled
at Topeka, on the 23d of October, 1855, and adjourned on the
11th of November, after a session of twenty days. It was composed of
forty-seven members, of whom thirty-one signed the Constitution. On
the 15th of December this instrument was submitted to the people for
ratification or rejection. Only 1,777 ballots were cast, all but 46 being
favorable. One of its sections, a provision excluding negroes and mulattoes
from the State, was submitted as an independent proposition, and
adopted by an affirmative vote of 1,287, to 453 against it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second convention was that held at Lecompton, which met on
the 7th of June, 1857, and after a session of four days, adjourned until the
19th of October, a final adjournment being reached on the 3d of November.
It was composed of sixty-four members, forty-five of whom signed
the organic law it framed, and its session continued twenty days. No
direct vote on this Constitution was provided for. The Schedule ordered
two forms of ballot, one, the "Constitution with Slavery," the
other, "Constitution with no Slavery." It was the old turkey and buzzard
choice. The Free State men refused to vote at the election, held on the
21st of December, and only 6,712 ballots were cast, 6,147 being for Slavery
and 569 against Slavery. The Free State men had, however, elected
a majority of the Territorial Legislature in October, and at a special session
of that body, held in December, a law was passed providing for a direct
vote on the Constitution. This election was held on the 14th of
January, 1858, resulting: against the Constitution, 10,266; for, 164—the
pro-Slavery men not voting. A third vote on the Lecompton instrument
was taken August 2d, 1858, Congress having ordered its re-submission
under the terms of the English bill. Again it was rejected, the ballots in
its favor being only 1,788, and those against it, 11,300.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>The Leavenworth Convention met at Minneola, March 23d, 1858,
and at once adjourned to Leavenworth, where it re-assembled March 25th.
It was composed of ninety-five members, was in session only eleven days,
and the Constitution it framed was signed by eighty-three persons. This
instrument was adopted at an election held May 11th, by a very small
vote, the pro-Slavery men taking no part in the contest. It was
never a popular organic law, and many Free State men who supported it
did so under protest. An earnest effort was made, by the Republicans,
to secure the admission of Kansas under the Topeka Constitution, and by
the Democrats, with a few exceptions to bring the Territory in under the
Lecompton Constitution. But no serious or determined contest was
waged, in Congress, for admission under the Leavenworth Constitution,
and in less than eight months the movement in its behalf was formally
abandoned.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE WYANDOTTE CONVENTION.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Early in February, 1859, the Territorial Legislature passed an act
submitting to the people the question of calling a Constitutional Convention.
This vote was taken March 28th, and resulted: For, 5,306; against,
1,425. On the 10th of May, 1859, the Republican party of Kansas was
organized, at Osawatomie, and at the election held on the 7th of June, for
delegates to the Wyandotte Convention, the Republican and Democratic
parties confronted each other in Kansas for the first time. The Democrats
carried the counties of Leavenworth, Doniphan, Jefferson and Jackson,
and elected one of the two delegates from Johnson. The Republicans
were successful in all the other Counties voting. The total vote
polled was 14,000. The Republican membership was thirty five; Democratic,
seventeen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Convention then chosen assembled on the 5th day of July, 1859.
In its composition it was an unusual, not to say remarkable, Kansas assemblage.
Apparently the chiefs of the contending parties had grown
weary of Constitution making, or regarded this fourth endeavor in that
line as a predestined failure, for they were conspicuous by their absence.
In the Topeka Convention nearly every prominent man of the Free State
party had a seat. Gen. Lane was its President, and Charles Robinson,
Martin F. Conway, Marcus J. Parrott, Wm. Y. Roberts, Geo. W. Smith,
Philip C. Schuyler, C. K. Holliday, Mark W. Delahay, and many other
recognized Free State leaders, were members. In the Leavenworth Convention
there was a similar gathering of widely-known Free State men.
Conway was its President, and Lane, Roberts, Thos. Ewing, jr., Henry J.
Adams, H. P. Johnson, S. N. Wood, T. Dwight Thacher, P. B. Plumb,
Joel K. Goodin, A. Larzalere, W. F. M. Arny, Chas. H. Branscomb,
John Ritchey, and many other influential Free State chiefs or partizans,
were among its members.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE MEMBERSHIP.</h3>

<p class='c006'>In the Wyandotte Convention all the noted Free State leaders were
conspicuously absent. Its roll-call was made up of names generally new
in Kansas affairs, and largely unknown in either the Free State or pro-Slavery
councils. Its President, James M. Winchell, his colleague, Wm.
McCullough, and John Ritchey, of Shawnee, had been members of the
Leavenworth Convention; Col. Caleb May, of Atchison, and W. R. Griffith,
of Bourbon, had been members of both the Topeka and the Leavenworth
Conventions; and Jas. M. Arthur, of Linn, had been a member of
the Topeka Convention. But their prominence was largely local. On
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the Democratic side, too, appeared men before unnoted in the annals of
the stirring and tremendous conflict that had for years made the young
Territory the cynosure of a Continent's interest. None of the prominent
pro-Slavery men who sat in the Lecompton Convention or the pro-Slavery
Legislatures—Calhoun, Stringfellow, Henderson, Elmore, Wilson,
Carr and others—appeared in this body.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the absence of these party leaders was a fortunate thing for
the Convention and the incipient State. For in discriminating intelligence,
in considerate zeal for the welfare of the people, in catholic grasp
of principles, and in capacity for defining theories clearly and compactly,
the members of this body were not wanting. On the other hand, there
were fewer jealousies and far less wrangling than would have been possible
had the envious and aspiring party leaders been present. I think it is
certain that the work was better done, done with more sobriety, sincerity,
prudence and real ability, than would have resulted had the recognized
chiefs of the rival parties been on the floor of the Convention. The pioneers—the
John Baptists—of the Free State cause were all at Topeka,
and the Constitution they framed is disfigured by some blotches and much
useless verbiage. The leaders were all at Leavenworth, where they
schemed for precedence, and spread traps to catch one another, and quarreled
over non-essentials, and did everything but make a popular Constitution.
Lecompton was the last expression of a beaten, desperate and
wrong-headed, but intellectually vigorous faction, and was really, barring
the mean method of its submission, and its attempt to perpetuate Slavery,
an admirable organic law.</p>

<p class='c000'>The younger men of the Territory constituted the Convention at
Wyandotte. They came upon the field fresh, enthusiastic, and with a
place in the world of thought and action to conquer. They recognized
the fact that they must do extremely well to secure popular favor, and
they set about their task with industry, intelligence and prudence. They
were not martyrs or reformers, as many of those at Topeka were; nor
jealous politicians or factionists, as most of those at Leavenworth were.
They had no old battles to fight over again, no personal feuds to distract
them, no recollection of former defeats or victories to reverse or maintain.
They were their own prophets. They had had no experience in Constitution
making, and hence did not look backward. They were not specialists.
A few had hobbies, but the vast majority had no bees buzzing in
their bonnets. A few were dogmatic, but the many were anxious to discuss,
and willing to be convinced. A few were loquacious, but the majority
were thinkers and workers. Some were accomplished scholars, but
the majority were men of ordinary education, whose faculties had been
sharpened and trained by the hard experience of an active and earnest
life. Many were vigorous, direct, intelligent speakers; several were
really eloquent; and a few may justly be ranked with the most versatile
and brilliant men Kansas has ever numbered among her citizens.</p>

<p class='c000'>Very few were old men. Only fifteen of the fifty-two members were
over forty. Over one-third were under thirty, and nearly two-thirds
under thirty-five. Very few, as I have said, had previously appeared as
representatives of the people in any Territorial assemblage, and this was
especially true of the men whose talents, industry and force soon approved
them leaders. Samuel A. Kingman had been in the Territory only
about eighteen months, and was unknown, outside of Brown county, until
he appeared at Wyandotte. Solon O. Thacher was a young lawyer of
Lawrence, never before prominent in public affairs. John J. Ingalls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>had served, the previous winter, as Engrossing Clerk of the Territorial
Council. Samuel A. Stinson was a young attorney, recently from Maine.
William C. McDowell had never been heard of outside of Leavenworth,
Benjamin F. Simpson was a boyish-looking lawyer from Miami county,
and John T. Burris had been practicing, for a year or two, before Justices'
courts in Johnson county. John P. Slough had been a member of
the Ohio Legislature, but was a new comer in Kansas; and E. G. Ross
was the publisher of a weekly newspaper at Topeka.</p>

<p class='c000'>One-half of the members had been in the Territory less than two
years. Six came in <a id='Africa'></a>1854, four in 1855, and twelve in 1856, while Mr.
Forman, of Doniphan, dated his residence from 1843; Mr. Palmer, of
Pottawatomie, from 1854, and Mr. Houston, of Riley, from 1853. Forty-one
were from Northern States, seven from the South, and four were of
foreign birth, England, Scotland, Ireland, and Germany each contributing
one. It appears singular that only one of the Western States, Indiana,
was represented in the membership, that State furnishing six delegates.
Twelve hailed from New England, Ohio contributed twelve,
Pennsylvania six, and New York four. Only eighteen belonged to the
legal profession—an unusually small number of lawyers in such a body.
Sixteen were farmers, eight merchants, three physicians, three manufacturers,
one a mechanic, one a printer, one a land agent, and one a surveyor.
The oldest member was Robert Graham, of Atchison, who was
55; the youngest, Benj. F. Simpson, of Lykins Co., (now Miami,) who
was 23.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>A WORKING BODY.</h3>

<p class='c006'>It was a working body, from the first hour of its session until the last.
There is a tradition that the Continental Congress which promulgated the
Declaration of Independence was materially hastened in its deliberations
over that immortal document by swarms of flies that invaded the hall
where it sat, and made the life of its members a burden. Perhaps the
intense heat of the rough-plastered room where the Convention met, or
the knowledge that Territorial scrip would be received by importunate
landlords only at a usurious discount, had something to do with urging
dispatch in business. But certainly the Convention went to work with
an energy and industry I have never seen paralleled in a Kansas deliberative
body since that time. It perfected its organization, adopted rules
for its government, discussed the best mode of procedure in framing a
Constitution, and appointed a Committee to report upon that subject,
during the first day's session; all the standing Committees were announced
on the third day; and by the close of the fifth day it had disposed
of two very troublesome contested election cases, decided that the
Ohio Constitution should be the model for that of Kansas, perfected arrangements
for reporting and printing its debates, and instructed its
Committees upon a number of disputed questions. The vote on selecting
a model for the Constitution was, on the second ballot: for the Ohio Constitution,
25 votes; Indiana, 23; and Kentucky, 1. So our Kansas Constitution
was modeled after that of Ohio—something, I think, as the
farmer's new house was designed after his old one; it was built upon the
old site.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE COMMITTEES.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The Chairmanships of the different Committees were assigned as
follows: Preamble and Bill of Rights—Wm. Hutchinson, of Lawrence.
Executive Department—John P. Greer, of Shawnee. Legislative Department—Solon
O. Thacher, of Lawrence. Judicial Department—Samuel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>A. Kingman, of Brown Co. Military—James G. Blunt, of Anderson
Co. Electors and Elections—P. H. Townsend, of Douglas.
Schedule—John T. Burris, of Johnson. Apportionment—H. D. Preston,
of Shawnee. Corporations and Banking—Robert Graham, of
Atchison. Education and Public Institutions—W. R. Griffith, of Bourbon
Co. County and Township Organizations—John Ritchey, of Topeka.
Ordinance and Public Debt—James Blood, of Lawrence.
Finance and Taxation—Benj. F. Simpson, of Lykins. Amendments and
Miscellaneous—S. D. Houston, of Riley Co. Federal Relations—T. S.
Wright, of Nemaha Co. Phraseology and Arrangements—John J. Ingalls,
of Atchison.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have studied the composition of these Committees with some interest,
reviewing the work of their members in the Convention, and recalling
their subsequent careers. And it appears to me that in making
them up, President Winchell exhibited phenomenally quick and accurate
judgment of men. He was, indeed, one of the best presiding officers I
have ever known. His imperturbable coolness, never for an instant
ruffled by the most sudden and passionate outbreaks of excitement in the
Convention; his mastery of all the niceties of parliamentary law; his
uniform courtesy and tact; his promptness and clearness in stating
his decisions; and above all, the mingled grace and kindness and firmness
with which he announced to an indignant member an adverse decision,
were really wonderful. But what shall be said of that still more
wonderful prescience with which he made up the Committees? What
induced this calm, grey-eyed, observing little man, whose brass-buttoned
blue coat was first seen by two-thirds of the Convention on the morning
of the 5th of July—what impelled him, within twenty-four hours, to
select an obscure, dull-looking, shock-headed country doctor as Chairman
of the Military Committee, and thus name in connection with military
affairs, for the first time, the only Kansas soldier who reached a full
Major Generalship? How did he happen to pass by half a dozen more
widely known lawyers, and appoint as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
a man who, during more than fifteen years thereafter, occupied a
place on the Supreme Bench of the State, for the greater portion of this
time as the Chief Justice? How came he to recognize so quickly, in
the Engrossing Clerk of the Territorial Legislature, the ripest scholar
and the fittest man in the body for the Chairmanship of the Committee
to which every article of the Constitution was referred for final revision
and amendment? In the youngest and most boyish-looking member he
found the man who was to form, for this State, a code of Finance and
Taxation whose clear directions and wholesome restrictions have guarded
Kansas against the wasteful extravagance of Legislatures and the curse
of a burdensome public debt, during all the tempting and perilous affairs
of its first quarter of a century. And he named, as head of the Committee
on Education, the first State Superintendent of Public Instruction.
All of his appointments were made with rare judgment, but those
mentioned appear notably discerning.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>PROGRESS OF WORK.</h3>

<p class='c006'>On the sixth day a resolution favoring biennial sessions of the Legislature—adopted
sixteen years afterward—was submitted and referred. The
first of a long series of resolutions or proposed sections of the Constitution,
prohibiting the settlement of negroes or mulattoes within the limits of the
State, was also introduced. This question, with others of a kindred nature,
such as propositions to prohibit colored children attending the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>schools, or to exclude them from the University, or to forbid the
appropriation of any funds for their education, and last, and meanest
of all, to deny to negroes the shelter of county poor houses when poor and
helpless, was voted upon again and again, first in one form and then in
another, and to the enduring honor of the majority, always defeated. It
seems singular, in this day and generation, that such theories found persistent
and earnest advocates. But it should be remembered that all this
happened before the war, when slavery was still an "institution" in nearly
half the States of the Union. The pro-Slavery party was, of course,
solidly in favor of excluding free negroes from the State, and less than
four years prior to the meeting of the Convention, the Free State party,
in voting on the Topeka Constitution, had given a decided majority in
favor of such exclusion. It therefore required genuine courage and principle
to go upon record against each and every proposition of this character.
For very few members who so voted felt absolutely certain of the
endorsement of their constituents.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first Article of the Constitution reported, that on Corporations
and Banks, was submitted on the sixth day and considered. It was
stated, by the President, that many other Committees had their reports
in the hands of the printer, and during the next few days they began to
come in very rapidly. The Convention, to expedite work, adopted a resolution
requiring all Committees to report on or before Saturday, the
eleventh day of the session.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE BOUNDARIES OF THE STATE.</h3>

<p class='c006'>On the seventh day the annexation of that portion of Nebraska lying
south of the Platte river, was formally considered. The then organized
Nebraska counties included in that section of our sister State had
elected delegates to the Convention, who were present earnestly advocating
annexation. This proposition was discussed during several days, and
the debates took a wide range. The Nebraska delegates were admitted
to seats as honorary members, with the privilege of speaking on this subject.
The final determination, however, was to preserve the original
Northern line. Two influences induced this decision, one political, the
other local and material. Many Republicans feared that the South
Platte Country was, or would be likely to become, Democratic. Lawrence
and Topeka both aspired to be the State Capital, and their influence
was against annexation, because they feared it would throw the center
of population far north of the Kaw.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Preamble and Bill of Rights was reported on the tenth day,
and opened the whole question of the State's boundaries. The Committee
proposed the twenty-third meridian as the western line, and the fortieth
parallel as the line on the north. This would have excluded about
ninety miles of territory within the present limits of the State. The
Committee's recommendation was, however, adopted, and stood as the
determination of the Convention until the day before the final adjournment,
when Col. May, of Atchison, secured a reconsideration, and on his
motion the twenty-fifth parallel was substituted for the twenty-third. The
northern boundary question was finally settled on the fifteenth day, when,
by a vote of 19 ayes to 29 nays, the Convention refused to memorialize
Congress to include the South Platte country within the limits of Kansas.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>FEATURES OF THE CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p class='c006'>On the seventh day the Legislative and Judicial Committees reported.
The Legislative article was considered next day. The Committee proposed
that bills might originate in either House, but Mr. Winchell submitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>a novel amendment, which required all laws to originate in the
House of Representatives. This was adopted, notwithstanding the vigorous
opposition of Mr. Thacher, the Chairman of the Committee, by a vote
of 37 to 13. It survived the admission of the State only three years,
being amended in 1864.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the eighth day the Militia article was adopted; on the ninth day
the Judicial article was perfected, and the article on Education and Public
Institutions reported and discussed; and on the tenth day the Committees
on County and Township Organizations, and Schedule, reported.
The deathless pertinacity of a "claim" is illustrated by a petition presented
that day, from one Samuel A. Lowe, a clerk of the so-called "Bogus
Legislature," who wanted pay for certain work he alleged he had performed.
Only a year ago Mr. Lowe presented the same claim to Congress,
and it was, I believe allowed by the House. But the Kansas Senators
made such determined war on it that Mr Lowe can still sing, "a
claim to keep I have."</p>

<p class='c000'>I have mentioned the fact that Mr Winchell was the author of the
section providing that all bills should originate in the House. It should
be stated that Mr. Ingalls was the author of the provision that "in actions
for libel, the truth may be given in evidence to the jury, and if it
shall appear that the alleged libelous matter was published for justifiable
ends, the accused shall be acquitted." Another original provision of the
Constitution is the Homestead section. This was first proposed by Mr.
Foster, of Leavenworth county, on the sixth day of the session, and reported
by the Committee on Miscellaneous and Amendments, on the
thirteenth day. No other feature of the Constitution, perhaps, elicited
more animated and earnest debate. It was discussed for several days;
amended, referred, and again submitted. As originally reported, it provided
for the exemption of "a homestead of 160 acres of land, or a house
and lot not exceeding $2,000 in value, or real, personal and mixed property
not exceeding $2,000, to any family." This was adopted by a vote
of 28 ayes to 16 nays. Two days later the vote was reconsidered, and
President Winchell proposed the wording finally adopted: "A homestead
of 160 acres of farming land, or of one acre within the limits of an
incorporated town or city, occupied as a residence by the family of the
owner, together with all the improvements on the same, shall be exempted
from forced sale under any process of law, and shall not be alienated
without the joint consent of husband and wife, where the relation exists."
Thus perfected, it was adopted by a vote of 33 to 7.</p>

<p class='c000'>I thought at the time, however, and a review of the proceedings and
debates has confirmed my impression that favorable action on this provision
was due to the earnest and eloquent advocacy of Judge Kingman,
who was its most zealous, logical and courageous supporter. The homestead
clause of the Kansas Constitution has been severely criticised, but
I believe the people of the State generally regard it as a most beneficent
provision of their organic law. For nearly a quarter of a century it has
been maintained, and it still stands, as Judge Kingman said it would,
guarding "the home, the hearthstone, the fireside around which a man
may gather his family with the certainty of assurance that neither the
hand of the law, nor any, nor all of the uncertainties of life, can eject
them from the possession of it."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Finance and Taxation and the Executive articles were adopted
on the fourteenth day, and the Miscellaneous article considered. This
originally provided for the election of a Public Printer, but that section
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>was stricken out, after a vigorous protest by Messrs. Ross and Ingalls.
Nine years later their idea was endorsed, by the adoption of an amendment
creating the office of State Printer.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the seventeenth day the temporary Capital was located at Topeka,
the second ballot resulting: for Topeka, 29; for Lawrence, 14; for
Atchison, 6.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE FIRST "PROHIBITION AMENDMENT."</h3>

<p class='c006'>On the same day a proposition was made, by Mr. Preston, of Shawnee
Co., to amend the Miscellaneous article by adding the following section:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sec. —. The Legislature shall have power to regulate or prohibit
the sale of alcoholic liquors, except for mechanical and medicinal
purposes."</p>

<p class='c000'>A motion made to lay this amendment on the table, was defeated, by
a vote of 18 ayes to 31 nays. But the anxiety of the members to exclude
from the Constitution any provision that might render its adoption doubtful,
or prevent the admission of the State, finally prevailed, and after a
full interchange of views, Mr. Preston withdrew his amendment. There
is, it is said, nothing new under the sun. Those who imagine that the
prohibition amendment adopted in 1880 was a new departure in Constitution
making, have never examined the records of the Wyandotte Convention.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE LAST OF SLAVERY IN KANSAS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>On the nineteenth day occurred the last struggle over the Slavery
question in Kansas. Sec. 6 of the Bill of Rights, prohibiting Slavery or
involuntary servitude, came up for adoption, and it was moved to add a
proviso suspending the operation of this section for the period of twelve
months after the admission of the State. This proviso received eleven
votes, and twenty-eight were recorded against it. A most exciting discussion
occurred, on the same day, over the apportionment article, which
the Democrats denounced as a "gerrymander."</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE LAST DAYS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The work of the Convention was practically completed on the
twenty-first day. The various articles had each been considered and
adopted, first in Committee of the whole, then in Convention, then referred
to the Committee on Phraseology and Arrangement, and, after report
of that Committee, again considered by sections and adopted. But
so anxious were the members that every word used should be the right
word, expressing the idea intended most clearly and directly, that when
the reading of the completed Constitution was finished, on the morning
of the 21st day, it was decided to refer it to a special committee, consisting
of Messrs. Ingalls, Winchell, Ross and Slough, for further revision
and verification. This Committee reported the same afternoon, and
again the Constitution was read by sections, for final revision, with the
same painstaking carefulness and attention to the minutest details. All
that afternoon, and all the next day, with brief interruptions for action
on other closing work, this revision went on, and it was five o'clock in the
afternoon of the 29th before the last section was perfected. Then occurred
one of the most dramatic scenes of the Convention. Mr. Hutchinson
submitted a resolution declaring that "we do now adopt and proceed
to sign the Constitution."</p>

<h3 class='c005'>A SPIRITED DEBATE.</h3>

<p class='c006'>At once Mr. Slough addressed the Chair, and after warmly eulogizing
the general features of the Constitution, pronouncing it "a model
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>instrument," he formally announced that political objections impelled
himself and his Democratic associates to decline attaching their signatures
to it. These objections he stated at length. They were, briefly: the
curtailment of the boundaries of the State; the large Legislative body
provided for; the exclusion of Indians made citizens of the United States,
from the privilege of voting; the registry of voters at the election on the
Constitution; the refusal to exclude free negroes from the State; and the
apportionment.</p>

<p class='c000'>This action of the Democratic members had been foreshadowed for
several days, but it was, nevertheless, something of a surprise. The Republicans
understood that several of the Democrats had earnestly opposed
such a course, and hoped that some of them would be governed
by their own convictions, rather than by the mandate of their caucus. For
a few moments after Mr. Slough concluded, the Convention sat, hushed and
expectant. But no other Democratic member rose. It was evident that
the caucus ruled. Then Judge Thacher, the President <em><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro tem.</span></em>, addressed
the Chair, and in a speech of remarkable vigor and eloquence,
accepted the gauge of battle thrown down. "Upon this Constitution,"
he declared, "we will meet our opponents in the popular arena. It is a
better, a nobler issue than even the old Free State issue. They have
thrown down the gauntlet; we joyfully take it up." He then proceeded
to defend, with great earnestness and power, the features of the Constitution
objected to by Mr. Slough. "The members of the Convention," he
asserted, "have perfected a work that will be enduring." The Constitution,
he affirmed, would "commend itself to the true and good
everywhere, because through every line and syllable there glows the generous
sunshine of liberty." It was and should be, he declared:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Like some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,</div>
      <div class='line'>Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm;</div>
      <div class='line'>Though round its breast the rolling clouds shall spread,</div>
      <div class='line'>Eternal sunshine settles on its head."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Read in the light of subsequent history, these declarations appear
almost prophetic.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>SIGNING THE CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p class='c006'>The twilight shadows were gathering about Wyandotte when this
debate closed, and the Convention proceeded to vote on Mr. Hutchinson's
resolution, which was adopted by 34 ayes to 13 nays—one Republican
and four Democrats being absent. The roll was then called, and the
Constitution was signed by all the Republican members except one, Mr.
Wright, of Nemaha, who was absent, sick. The work of the Convention
was completed, and after voting thanks to its officers, it adjourned without
date.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>TWO MISTAKES.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Each party, I think, was guilty of one blunder it afterwards seriously
regretted—the Republicans in refusing to include the South Platte
country within the boundaries of Kansas; the Democrats in refusing to
sign the Constitution they had labored diligently to perfect. I speak of
what I consider the great mistake of the Republicans with all the more
frankness because I was, at the time, in hearty sympathy with their action;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>but I feel confident that no Republican member is living to-day
who does not deplore that decision. And I am equally confident that
within a brief time after the Convention adjourned, there were few Democratic
members who did not seriously regret their refusal to sign the
Constitution.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>"ADDED TO THE STARS."</h3>

<p class='c006'>On the 4th of October, 1859, the Constitution was submitted to the
people for ratification or rejection, and, for the first time in the history
of Kansas, all parties cast a full, free and unintimidated vote. The Republicans
favored, and the Democrats generally opposed its adoption.
Nearly 16,000 ballots were polled, of which 10,421 were for, and 5,530
against the Constitution. The Homestead clause, submitted as an independent
proposition, was ratified by a vote of 8,788 for, to 4,772 against
it. Every county in the territory except two, Johnson and Morris, gave
a majority for the Constitution.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two months later, December 6th, State and County officers and
members of the Legislature were elected, and the people of Kansas, having
exhausted their authority in State building, patiently awaited the
action of Congress. On the 11th of April, 1860, the House of Representatives
voted, 134 to 73, to admit Kansas as a State, under the Wyandotte
Constitution. Twice, during the next eight months, the Senate defeated
motions to consider the Kansas bill, but on the 21st of January,
1861, several Southern Senators having seceded, Mr. Seward "took a
pinch of snuff" and called it up again. It passed by a vote of 36 to 16,
and on the 29th of the same month President Buchanan approved it.
Thus young Kansas, through many difficulties and turmoils, was "added
to the Stars."</p>

<h3 class='c005'>AN ENDURING CONSTITUTION.</h3>

<p class='c006'>During nearly twenty-two of the most eventful and exciting years
of American history, the Constitution thus framed and ratified has defined
the powers and regulated the duties of the government of Kansas. Three
Legislatures have voted down propositions to call a new Constitutional
Convention. Twelve or fifteen amendments have been submitted, but
only eight have been approved by the people. Finally, in 1880, the
Legislature voted to submit a proposal for a new Convention, and at the
regular election held in November of that year, this ballot was taken.
The result was an endorsement of the old Wyandotte Constitution by a
majority far more emphatic and overwhelming than that by which it was
originally adopted, the vote standing 22,870 for, and 146,279 against the
proposed Convention, or nearly seven to one.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is doubtful whether the organic law of any other State in the
Union has more successfully survived the mutations of time and inconstant
public sentiment, and the no less fluctuating necessities of a swiftly
developing Commonwealth. Of its seventeen articles, only four, and of
its one hundred and seventy-eight sections, only eight, have ever been
amended. And of the eight amendments adopted, only five have revoked
or modified the principles or policy originally formulated, the others being
changes demanded by the growth of the State, or by the events of the
civil war. The first amendment, ratified in 1861, provides that no banking
institution shall issue circulating notes of a less denomination than
$1—the original limitation being $5. In 1864 the provision requiring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>all bills to originate in the House of Representatives, was repealed; and
a section intended to prevent U. S. soldiers from voting, but which was
so worded that it deprived our volunteers of that right, was also repealed.
In 1867 an amendment was adopted disfranchising all persons who aided
the "Lost Cause," or who were dishonorably discharged from the army
of the United States, or who had defrauded the United States or any
State during the war. In 1868 the State Printer amendment was ratified.
In 1873 the number of Senators and Representatives, originally
limited to 33 and 100, respectively, was increased to 40 and 125. In
1875 three propositions, each having in view biennial instead of annual
sessions of the Legislature, were adopted. And in 1880 the Prohibition
amendment was ratified. These are all the changes that have been made
in our organic law during nearly a quarter of a century.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>PARTING AT WYANDOTTE.</h3>

<p class='c006'>It would violate the proprieties of such an occasion to comment on
the personal feuds or partisan broils which once or twice marred the
general harmony and orderly progress of the proceedings. These were
very few, indeed, and none of them, I think, outlasted the Convention.
The members parted, when the final adjournment came, with mutual respect
and good will, and the friendships formed during the session have
been unusually warm and enduring.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>SUBSEQUENT HISTORY.</h3>

<p class='c006'>It seems fitting that, in concluding this sketch of the Convention
and its labors, I should briefly narrate the subsequent history of its members.
It was a small company, that which parted here twenty-three years
ago to-day, and it was made up, as I have said, largely of young and vigorous
men. But when this reunion was first suggested, and I came to look over
the familiar names I had so often called during the long, hot days of that
far away July, it was painful to note the havoc death had made. It impressed
me something as did a roll-call I once witnessed, in the red glare
of bivouac fires after one of the great battles of the war, when surviving
comrades answered "killed," or "wounded," to one-half the names of a
regiment. Ten of the fifty-two members composing the Convention I
have not heard of for many years. Of the remaining forty-two, twenty
rest quietly in</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in18'>—"The reconciling grave,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where all alike lie down in peace together."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The largest delegation was that from Leavenworth county, and only
one of the ten gentlemen comprising it, R. C. Foster, certainly survives.
Rare Sam Stinson, whose genial wit and brilliant accomplishments won
all hearts, was elected Attorney General in 1861, by a unanimous vote,
and died in his old Maine home, in February, 1866. William C. McDowell
was chosen Judge of the First Judicial District at the first election
under the Constitution; served four years; and was killed by a fall
from an omnibus in St. Louis, July 16, 1866. John P. Slough removed
to Colorado, was Colonel of a regiment raised in that State, and later a
Brigadier General; was appointed, after the war, Chief Justice of New
Mexico, and was killed at Santa Fe. Samuel Hipple removed to Atchison
county; served as a Quartermaster during the war; was elected State
Senator in 1867; and died in January, 1876. William Perry removed
to Colorado, where he died. P. S. Parks returned to Indiana, and engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>in journalism and the law until his death, three years ago. Fred.
Brown died in St. Joseph, Mo., and John Wright at his home in Leavenworth
county. Robert Graham, of Atchison county, the oldest member,
died in 1868. Three of the five members from Doniphan county, Robert
J. Porter, Benjamin Wrigley and John Stairwalt, are dead. The members
from Linn, James M. Arthur and Josiah Lamb, are both dead, as
are also N. C. Blood, of Douglas, and T. S. Wright, of Nemaha. W. R.
Griffith, of Bourbon, was elected the first State Superintendent of Public
Instruction, and died, February 12th, 1862, before the completion of his
term. James G. Blunt, of Anderson, who became a Major General during
the war, and won renown as a brave and skillful soldier, died, in
Washington, a year or more ago. James Hanway, of Franklin, after a
long life of usefulness, died at his old home, only a brief while ago.
President James M. Winchell returned to New York shortly after the
outbreak of the rebellion, and resumed his connection with the <cite>Times</cite>,
first as war correspondent and afterwards as an editorial writer. Until
his death, a few years since, he was employed upon that great journal.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>SURVIVING MEMBERS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Of the surviving members, many have attained the highest distinctions
of the State, and all, I believe are useful and honored citizens. At
the first election under the Constitution, Samuel A. Kingman was chosen
as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court; in 1866 he was elected
Chief Justice, and re-elected in 1872. Benj. F. Simpson was elected the
first Attorney General of the State, but resigned the position to enter the
army, in which he served throughout the war. He has since been
Speaker of the House of Representatives, several times a State Senator,
and is now serving his second term as U. S. Marshal. Solon O. Thacher
was chosen District Judge at the first election under the Constitution,
has since occupied many positions of honor and responsibility, and is a
member of the present State Senate. J. C. Burnett, S. D. Houston and
S. E. Hoffman were members of the first State Senate, and Geo. H.
Lillie was a member of the first House of Representatives. E. G. Ross
was appointed United States Senator in 1866, and elected in 1867, serving
until 1871. John J. Ingalls was chosen as State Senator in 1861; was
elected United States Senator in 1873, and re-elected in 1879, and is
still occupying that distinguished place. John T. Burris was Lieut.
Col. of the 10th Kansas, and subsequently District Judge. Wm. P.
Dutton, James Blood, L. R. Palmer, John P. Greer and John Ritchey
have filled many positions of local trust and prominence, with credit and
usefulness. R. C. Foster and John W. Forman are residing in Texas;
William Hutchinson lives in Washington; and C. B. McClellan, E.
Moore and E. M. Hubbard are still prominent and honored citizens of
the counties they represented. My old friend, Col. Caleb May, sole surviving
member of the three Free State Constitutional Conventions, lives
in Montgomery Co. If Dean Swift was right in saying that "whoever
could make two ears of corn, or two blades of grass, to grow on a spot
of ground where one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and
do more essential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians,"
what honor is due this sturdy Kansas farmer, who, during a
residence of twenty-eight years in the State, has never—not even in the
disastrous seasons of 1860 and 1874—failed to raise a good crop. Even
the heroic service he rendered the cause of Freedom during the darkest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>days of the struggle in Kansas, was less valuable to the State than this
practical and triumphant vindication of its soil and climate.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>"LOST TO SIGHT."</h3>

<p class='c006'>Stalwart, quiet Wm. McCullough I have not heard of for many
years. John A. Middleton, of Marshall Co., was a soldier in the 7th
Kansas, removed to Montana in 1864, and I have learned nothing of him
since. H. D. Preston, of Shawnee; R. L. Williams, P. H. Townsend
and Ed. Stokes, of Douglas; Allen Crocker, of Woodson; A. D.
McCune, of Leavenworth; J. H. Signor, of Allen, and J. T. Barton,
of Johnson, have all disappeared and left no sign. I know not
whether they are living or dead.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>THE OFFICERS.</h3>

<p class='c006'>Of the officers of the Convention, queer old George Warren,
Sergeant-at-arms of nearly all the early Kansas Legislatures and Conventions,
died many years ago. Ed. S. Nash, the Journal Clerk, was
Adjutant of the 1st Kansas, and died, some years since, in Chicago. Robt.
St. Clair Graham, one of the Enrolling Clerks, was elected Judge of the
Second Judicial District in 1866, and died in 1880. Richard J. Hinton,
also an Enrolling Clerk, is the editor of the Washington (D. C.) <cite>Gazette</cite>,
and a widely known journalist. Werter R. Davis, the Chaplain, was a
member of the first State Legislature; was Chaplain of the 12th and
Colonel of the 16th Kansas regiments during the war; and is one of the
most prominent clergymen of his denomination in the State. S. D. McDonald,
printer to the Convention, is still engaged in journalism. J. M.
Funk, the door-keeper, and J. L. Blanchard, the Assistant Secretary, I
have not heard from or of for many years.</p>

<h3 class='c005'>CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p class='c006'>I wish I could sketch more in detail the work and history of the
members of the Convention. But this paper is, I know, already too long.
I have tried to tell how our Constitution was made. I could not narrate,
within reasonable limits,</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"What workman wrought its ribs of steel,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,</div>
      <div class='line'>What anvils rang, what hammers beat,</div>
      <div class='line'>In what a forge and what a heat</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Were shaped the anchors of its hope."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It is enough to say that the work has proved strong and enduring.
Through the groping inexperience of our State's childhood and the still
more perilous ambitions of its youth, through the storm of civil war and
the calm of prosperous peace, the Wyandotte Convention has justified
the confident hopes of its early friends. The most marvelous changes
have been wrought in this country since it was framed. The huge brick
building in which the Convention held its sessions, long ago crumbled
and fell. The distracted, dependent and turbulent Territory has grown
to be a peaceful, powerful and prosperous State. Its hundred thousand
people have multiplied to a million. Upon its vast and solitary prairies,
where then bloomed a wild and unprofitable vegetation, "wherewith the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>mower filleth not his hand, nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom," miles
of green meadows now glisten with morning dew, and thousands of golden
wheat fields shimmer in the noonday sun, and millions of acres of tasseling
corn, rustling in the sweet twilight air, tell of harvests so bountiful
that they would feed a continent. Every quiet valley and prairie swell is
dotted with pleasant homes, where happy children laugh and play and
men and women go their busy ways in prosperous content. Eager learners
throng eight thousand school houses. Church bells ring in nearly
every county from the Missouri to the Colorado line. More than four
thousand miles of railway bind town and country, factory and farm and
store, into one community. And over all the institutions and activities of
this great, intelligent and orderly Commonwealth, broods the genius and
spirit of the Wyandotte Convention. Under its ample authority and
direction, just and generous laws have maintained the rights of citizenship,
given protection to labor and property, stimulated enterprise, multiplied
industries, opened to every child and youth the door of school and
college, encouraged morality, fostered temperance, protected the weak,
restrained the strong, and sternly punished outbreaking crime. And still
the sunshine of popular confidence and favor falls upon the Constitution.
It has outlived half of its framers, and when, a quarter of a century
hence, the last surviving member of the Convention awaits the inevitable
hour, the Wyandotte Constitution may yet be the chart and compass ordering
and guiding the destinies of a State whose imperial manhood is
foreshadowed by its stalwart and stately youth.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
